Dear Steve

Based on the stock analysis, from the 12 stocks provided only two of then had a positive return in 2018. The ENPH and the RUN stocks were around the +80% mark.

DQ was down 63% on 2018, what comes from a surprise because the 2017 performance was astonishing, with a 200% high.

If the 2017 results were to be compared to the 2018, almost all stocks that performed good on 2017, had a terrible 2018. Only the two stocks mentioned in the beginning (ENPH and RUN), were able to maintain a good performance.
